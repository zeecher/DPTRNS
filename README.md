__The Strategy Pattern__ defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

clients that use it.

----

__The Observer Pattern__ defines a one-to-many
dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all of its dependents are
notified and updated automatically.
