# DPTRNS


__The Strategy Pattern__ defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
clients that use it.

----

__The Observer Pattern__ defines a one-to-many
dependency between objects so that when one
object changes state, all of its dependents are
notified and updated automatically.

# OO Design Principles

  <dt>Favor composition over inheritance</dt>

  <dt>Program to interface, not implementations</dt>
  <dd></dd>

  <dt>Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.</dt>
  <dd>Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the    interdependency between objects.</dd>
  
  <dt>Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.</dt>
  <dd>Our goal is to allow classes to be easily extended to
incorporate new behavior without modifying existing code.
What do we get if we accomplish this? Designs that are
resilient to change and fl exible enough to take on new
functionality to meet changing requirements.</dd>
